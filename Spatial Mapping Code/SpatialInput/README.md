# Spatial Input

## Samples\

* [Demo Room](Samples/DemoRoom) - DirectX 11 UWP C++/WinRT sample application demonstrating a variety of application/uses of Windows Perception APIs. This sample uses the Pbr, Gltf, Neso, and SpatialInputUtilities libraries.
* [Motion Controller Rendering Sample](Samples/RenderController) - DirectX 11 UWP C++/WinRT sample application demonstrating how to render a motion controller. This sample uses the Pbr, Gltf and SpatialInputUtilities libraries.

## Libs\

* [Gltf](Libs/Gltf) - Helper functions to parse data returned by TinyGLTF.
* [Neso](Libs/Neso) - Simple Entity-Component-System (ECS) engine for real-time applications. Depends on Pbr, Gltf, and SpatialInputUtilities libs.
* [Pbr](Libs/Pbr) - Shaders and code for creating and rendering models in DirectX 11 using the PBR Metallic-Roughness model.
* [SpatialInputUtilities](Libs/SpatialInputUtilities) - Utilities for handling spatial input sources including motion controllers.
